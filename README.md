# Dodge

Dodge is a 2 dimensional survival game created in python using the pygame library.  

By using python as the backend for the game, as opposed to a game engine, every piece of logic used to allow the game to run must be built 
from the ground up.

The physics (collisions) and the particle system all uses logic fully developed by me without the use of an outside library.

Each class of the game is defined in its own file and each class interacts with each other as outlined in the main.py file
